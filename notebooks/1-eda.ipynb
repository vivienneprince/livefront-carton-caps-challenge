      "### Carton Caps Referral Program Rules\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Eligibility\n",
      "- All existing Carton Caps users with a verified account are eligible to refer friends.\n",
      "- Referred users must be new to the Carton Caps program.\n",
      "- Each user must be a legal resident of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Referral Process\n",
      "- Users can share a unique referral code or link via the Carton Caps app.\n",
      "- The referred user must use the referral code or link during the sign-up process or within a defined window after first installing the app (e.g., within 48 hours).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reward Structure\n",
      "- Referrer Bonus: The referrer receives a bonus (e.g., $5 or equivalent in Carton Caps credits) when:\n",
      "    - The referred user completes onboarding, and\n",
      "    - Performs a qualifying action (e.g., makes their first eligible product scan or links to a school).\n",
      "- Referred User Bonus: The new user receives a welcome bonus (e.g., $5) upon successful sign-up and qualifying action.\n",
      "- Bonuses are credited to Carton Caps accounts and may be limited to school donations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Limitations & Abuse\n",
      "- Self-referrals are not allowed (e.g., same device, email, or payment method).\n",
      "- Carton Caps may use fraud detection to block suspicious referrals or accounts.\n",
      "- Referrals may not be paid for or promoted via misleading methods (spam, bots, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Program Changes\n",
      "- Carton Caps reserves the right to:\n",
      "    - Modify or terminate the referral program at any time.\n",
      "    - Withhold rewards for suspected abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Carton Caps Referral Program – Frequently Asked Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What is the Carton Caps Referral Program?\n",
      "The Carton Caps Referral Program allows you to invite your friends to join the Carton Caps app. When your friend signs up using your unique referral link and completes onboarding, both of you receive a special bonus in your Carton Caps accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. How do I refer a friend?\n",
      "You can refer a friend directly from the Carton Caps app. Simply:\n",
      "- Tap on the account icon to see account options.\n",
      "- Tap “Invite Friends” from the menu.\n",
      "- Copy the referral code and send to your friend -or- share a link by using the buttons in the “Share Now” section.\n",
      "- Your friend must install the app using your link or sign up using your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. What does my friend experience when they join via my link?\n",
      "Referred users get a customized onboarding experience that introduces them to Carton Caps and highlights how the program supports schools. They'll also be notified about the bonus they and you will receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. When do we receive the bonus?\n",
      "Both you and your referred friend will receive the bonus after your friend completes onboarding and links their Carton Caps account to a preferred school to support.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. What kind of bonus do we get?\n",
      "The bonus may vary from time to time. It could be additional Carton Caps points or a special in-app reward. The current bonus will be displayed on the referral page in the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Can I refer more than one person?\n",
      "Absolutely! There's no limit to how many friends you can invite. You’ll earn a bonus for each successful referral!\n",
      "\n",
      "7. My friend forgot to use my link. Can we still get the bonus?\n",
      "Unfortunately, referrals must be tracked through your unique link. If your friend signs up without it, the referral won’t be credited automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Can I refer someone who already uses Carton Caps?\n",
      "The referral program is only available for new users. Existing users or users who uninstall and reinstall the app are not eligible for referral bonuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. How can I track my referrals?\n",
      "In the “Refer a Friend” section of the app, you can view the status of each referral - whether your friend has signed up, completed onboarding, and whether your bonus has been awarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Why haven’t I received my bonus yet?\n",
      "There may be a delay if your referred friend hasn’t completed onboarding or hasn’t linked to a school. If it’s been more than 48 hours and you believe there's an issue, contact our support team via the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Are there any restrictions or abuse policies?\n",
      "Yes. Carton Caps reserves the right to withhold bonuses or disable accounts if we detect fraudulent or abusive behavior, including self-referrals, spamming, or fake accounts.\n"
